# Craving Capybaras

## A *VERY* hungry Capybara

Craving Capybara is a fun and simple game where you can feed a Capybara named **Kiwi**.
There are a variety of food items you can feed to Kiwi such as:
- watermelon
- library books
- fresh linen

Kiwi is a demanding but adorable companion! Anyone can play this game! You can get to know more about Capybaras and 
their food preferences as you satisfy Kiwi's ever-growing desire to eat.

This project is interesting to me as I've always been interested in game design and animals! I especially adore
Capybara, who are the largest rodents in the world and still unknown to many people. I hope that this game
can educate more people about these weird and incredible animals.

# Phase 4: Task 3
If I had more time to work on the project, I would...
- Implement CapybaraGUI in separate classes for increased cohesion
- Remove the Main class as the function doesn't need to be in its own class, but rather implemented with some more code
elsewhere
